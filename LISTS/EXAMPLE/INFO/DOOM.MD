# Description of Doom

*Doom* and its sequel, *Doom II*, are
arguably among the most important
games in the history of PC gaming.

Though there were older games that
involved the exploration of 3D
rendered environments in first
person, including 1990’s Castle
Master, in which you hunted demons
and found treasures in a fully
3D-rendered haunted castle, the first
person shooter boom began in earnest
with **Apogee Software** and **id**
**Software’s** smash hit *Wolfenstein 3D*.
